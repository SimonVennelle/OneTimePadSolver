# OneTimePadSolver
Solves One Time Pad Cyphers using the plain text cipher and its key

In cryptography, the one-time pad (OTP) is an encryption technique that requires the use of a single-use pre-shared key that is no smaller than the message being sent. In this technique, a plaintext is paired with a random secret key (also referred to as a one-time pad). Then, each bit or character of the plaintext is encrypted by combining it with the corresponding bit or character from the pad using modular addition.
